 <title>Configuring virtual machines with &vmm;</title>
 <para>
  The left panel of the window lists &vmguest; overview and already installed
  hardware. After clicking an item in the list, you can access its detailed
  settings in the details view. You can change the hardware parameters to match
  your needs, then click <guimenu>Apply</guimenu> to confirm them. Some changes
  take effect immediately, while others need a reboot of the machine&mdash;and
  <systemitem>virt-manager</systemitem> warns you about that fact.

  <title>Machine setup</title>

  <para>
   This section describes the setup of the virtualized processor and memory
   hardware. These components are vital to a &vmguest;, therefore you cannot
   remove them. It also shows how to view the overview and performance
   information, and how to change boot parameters.
